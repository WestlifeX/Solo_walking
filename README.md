# Solo_walking
 This code implements a LIPM model to make quadruped Solo walk
 First you should generate the trajectories, then you map the trajectory into the TSID control loop frequency
 As a last step you perform the trajectory inside a PyBullet simulator
 
 The structure of the code is the same of Prof. A. Del Prete in TSID examples
